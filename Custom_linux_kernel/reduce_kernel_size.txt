Smaller the size of the Kernel fast the booting is.

-Reasons behind having a small kernel and system.
1. We all like to use Linux because its functionality and community support.
2. It can be run on very small systems. So it can be useful for IOT.
3. Run Linux as a bootloader, this reduce the time of drivers development.
4.Boot faster
5.Reduce Power consumption .
6.Reduce the attack surface.

How small a normal Linux syatem be ?

RAM:
-we need 2-6 MB of RAM for an embedded kernel 
-need at atleast 8-16 MB to leave enough space for the user space, if it is not that much complicated.
-more RAM leads to better performance.

STORAGE :
-2-4 MB space for embedded kernel
-few hundred KB for the user space.
-without any complex user space 8-16 MB is enough.

Compiler Optimizations

-gcc offers an easy-to-use way to optimize and minimizing the binary size -
